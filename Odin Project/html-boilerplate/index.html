    <h1>Learning some HTML! This is the biggest and most important header</h1> 
      <p> This is going to be the first paragraph. I will make two</p>
      <p> This is the second paragraph. Hopefully this works. I will also
            try using the <em> emphasize </em> to italicize and the <strong>
                  element to make this bold
            </strong>
      </p> 
    <h2>I WILL WORK WITH LISTS IN THIS heading</h2>
      <p> This will be an <strong> unordered list </strong> of yu-gi-oh sets that I enjoy</p>
      <ul>
            <li> Cyberstorm Access</li>
            <li> Ghosts from the Past: Second Haunting</li>
            <li> Legend of Blue Eyes White Dragon </li>
      </ul>
      <p>This will be an <em> ORDERED </em> list of my favorite fruits</p>
      <ol>
            <li>Mango</li>
            <li>Watermelon</li>
            <li>Banana</li>
      </ol>
    <h3>Cool! It worked out well. This is the second heading. 
      This one should be smaller than the second heading.
    </h3>
      <p> 
      If this were an article, this subheading page would be the second area 
      where I woould put some text. Like some <em> breaking news </em> type shit
